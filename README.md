# Activity-Classification
we investigate the problems ofactivity classification using a deep learning
approach. For this task of activity classification, we
achieved a classification accuracy of 80.51% across 20 ac-
tivity categories. Using our relatively simple models, we
were able to produce results for human pose estimation that
beat those of local detectors, which demonstrates the power
of CNNs in challenging visual recognition tasks.
